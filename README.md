# OS_Project
Operating Systems Project 
 Kernel-Level Development | C Language | Memory Management

Designed and implemented advanced memory management features in a custom educational operating system (FOS), simulating virtual memory techniques found in modern OSs. Key contributions include:

Kernel Heap Manager: Built dynamic memory allocation/deallocation using Best Fit strategy.

Page Fault Handler: Handled runtime memory faults using a Modified Clock page replacement algorithm.

Virtual Memory Support: Integrated working sets, page buffering, and a secondary page file to simulate demand paging.

User Heap Management: Implemented system calls to support user-space dynamic allocation (malloc/free).

Ensured correctness via automated test cases and modular design
